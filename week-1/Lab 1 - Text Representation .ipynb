their substance still lives sweet.\\n\\n6\\n\\nThen let not winter\\'s ragged hand deface\\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled.\\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place\\nWith beauty\\'s treasure ere it be self-killed.\\nThat use is not forbidden usury\\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\\nThat\\'s for thyself to breed another thee,\\nOr ten times happier, be it ten for one.\\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art\\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee;\\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\\n  Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair\\n  To be death\\'s conquest and make worms thine heir.\\n\\n7\\n\\nLo, in the orient when the gracious light\\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\\nServing with looks his sacred majesty;\\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage.\\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car\\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\\nThe eyes, \\'fore duteous, now converted are\\nFrom his low tract and look another way.\\n  So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,\\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\\n\\n8\\n\\nMusic to hear, why hear\\'st thou music sadly?\\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.\\nWhy lov\\'st thou that which thou receiv\\'st not gladly,\\nOr else receiv\\'st with pleasure thine annoy?\\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\nBy unions married, do offend thine ear,\\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.\\nMark how one string, sweet husband to another,\\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering,\\nResembling sire and child and happy mother\\nWho, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;\\n  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,\\n  Sings this to thee: \"Thou single wilt prove none.\"\\n\\n9\\n\\nIs it for fear to wet a widow\\'s eye\\nThat thou consum\\'st thyself in single life?\\nAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep\\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\\nBy children\\'s eyes, her husband\\'s shape in mind.\\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\nBut beauty\\'s waste hath in the world an end,\\nAnd, kept unused, the user so destroys it.\\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\\n  That on himself such murd\\'rous shame commits.\\n\\n10\\n\\nFor shame deny that thou bear\\'st love to any,\\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\\nGrant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\\nBut that thou none lov\\'st is most evident.\\nFor thou art so possessed with murd\\'rous hate\\nThat \\'gainst thyself thou stick\\'st not to conspire,\\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.\\nO, change thy thought, that I may change my mind.\\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\\nBe as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.\\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\\n\\n11\\n\\nAs fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow\\'st\\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest;\\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow\\'st\\nThou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.\\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\nWithout this, folly, age, and cold decay.\\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\\nAnd threescore year would make the world away.\\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish;\\nLook whom she best endowed she gave the more,\\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.\\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby\\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\\n\\n12\\n\\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time\\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\\nWhen I behold the violet past prime\\nAnd sable curls all silvered o\\'er with white;\\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\nAnd summer\\'s green all girded up in sheaves\\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard;\\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow;\\n  And nothing \\'gainst Time\\'s scythe can make defense\\n  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\n\\n13\\n\\nO, that you were your self! But, love, you are\\nNo longer yours than you yourself here live;\\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.\\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\\nFind no determination; then you were\\nYour self again after yourself\\'s decease\\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\nWhich husbandry in honor might uphold\\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter\\'s day\\nAnd barren rage of death\\'s eternal cold?\\n  O, none but unthrifts, dear my love, you know.\\n  You had a father; let your son say so.\\n\\n14\\n\\nNot from the stars do I my judgment pluck,\\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy--\\nBut not to tell of good or evil luck,\\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons\\' quality;\\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,\\nPointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,\\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.\\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\\nAnd, constant stars, in them I read such art\\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\\nIf from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;\\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:\\n  Thy end is truth\\'s and beauty\\'s doom and date.\\n\\n15\\n\\nWhen I consider everything that grows\\nHolds in perfection but a little moment,\\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;\\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\\nCheered and checked even by the selfsame sky,\\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory;\\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay\\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with Decay\\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night;\\n  And, all in war with Time for love of you,\\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\\n\\n16\\n\\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time,\\nAnd fortify yourself in your decay\\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\\nAnd many maiden gardens, yet unset,\\nWith virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,\\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit.\\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\\nWhich this time\\'s pencil or my pupil pen\\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\\nCan make you live yourself in eyes of men.\\n  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,\\n  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\\n\\n17\\n\\nWho will believe my verse in time to come\\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?\\nThough yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb\\nWhich hides your life and shows not half your parts.\\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes\\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\nThe age to come would say \"This poet lies;\\nSuch heavenly touches ne\\'er touched earthly faces.\"\\nSo should my papers, yellowed with their age,\\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet\\'s rage\\nAnd stretched meter of an antique song.\\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\\n  You should live twice--in it and in my rhyme.\\n\\n18\\n\\nShall I compare thee to a summer\\'s day?\\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\nAnd summer\\'s lease hath all too short a date.\\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\\nBy chance or nature\\'s changing course untrimmed.\\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\\'st,\\nNor shall Death brag thou wand\\'rest in his shade,\\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\\'st.\\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\\n\\n19\\n\\nDevouring Time, blunt thou the lion\\'s paws\\nAnd make the Earth devour her own sweet brood;\\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger\\'s jaws,\\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;\\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet\\'st\\nAnd do whate\\'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,\\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets.\\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime:\\nO, carve not with thy hours my love\\'s fair brow,\\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\\nHim in thy course untainted do allow\\nFor beauty\\'s pattern to succeeding men.\\n  Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,\\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\\n\\n20\\n\\nA woman\\'s face with Nature\\'s own hand painted\\nHast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\\nA woman\\'s gentle heart, but not acquainted\\nWith shifting change, as is false women\\'s fashion;\\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\\nWhich steals men\\'s eyes and women\\'s souls amazeth.\\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created,\\nTill Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated\\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\\n  But since she pricked thee out for women\\'s pleasure,\\n  Mine be thy love, and thy love\\'s use their treasure.\\n\\n21\\n\\nSo is it not with me as with that muse\\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\\nWho heaven itself for ornament doth use\\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea\\'s rich gems,\\nWith April\\'s firstborn flowers and all things rare\\nThat heaven\\'s air in this huge rondure hems.\\nO, let me, true in love, but truly write,\\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair\\nAs any mother\\'s child, though not so bright\\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven\\'s air.\\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;\\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\\n\\n22\\n\\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old\\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\\nBut when in thee Time\\'s furrows I behold,\\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee\\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me;\\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\\nO, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary\\nAs I not for myself but for thee will,\\nBearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary\\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\\n  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain.\\n  Thou gav\\'st me thine not to give back again.\\n\\n23\\n\\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage\\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\nWhose strength\\'s abundance weakens his own heart;\\nSo I for fear of trust forget to say\\nThe perfect ceremony of love\\'s rite,\\nAnd in mine own love\\'s strength seem to decay,\\nO\\'ercharged with burden of mine own love\\'s might.\\nO, let my books be then the eloquence\\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\\nWho plead for love and look for recompense\\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.\\n  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ.\\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love\\'s fine wit.\\n\\n24\\n\\nMine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled\\nThy beauty\\'s form in table of my heart;\\nMy body is the frame wherein \\'tis held,\\nAnd perspective it is best painter\\'s art.\\nFor through the painter must you see his skill\\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\\nWhich in my bosom\\'s shop is hanging still,\\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\\nAre windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun\\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.\\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art:\\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\\n\\n25\\n\\nLet those who are in favor with their stars\\nOf public honor and proud titles boast,\\nWhilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,\\nUnlooked for joy in that I honor most.\\nGreat princes\\' favorites their fair leaves spread\\nBut as the marigold at the sun\\'s eye,\\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\\nThe painful warrior famoused for worth,\\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\\nIs from the book of honor razed quite,\\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled.\\n  Then happy I, that love and am beloved\\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\\n\\n26\\n\\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit,\\nTo thee I send this written embassage\\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit;\\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\\nIn thy soul\\'s thought, all naked, will bestow it;\\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving\\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving\\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect.\\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;\\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\\n\\n27\\n\\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\\nThe dear repose for limbs with travel tired,\\nBut then begins a journey in my head\\nTo work my mind when body\\'s work\\'s expired.\\nFor then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see;\\nSave that my soul\\'s imaginary sight\\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\\nWhich like a jewel hung in ghastly night\\nMakes black night beauteous and her old face new.\\n  Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\\n  For thee and for myself no quiet find.\\n\\n28\\n\\nHow can I then return in happy plight\\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest,\\nWhen day\\'s oppression is not eased by night,\\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed;\\nAnd each, though enemies to either\\'s reign,\\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee?\\nI tell the day to please him thou art bright\\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;\\nSo flatter I the swart complexioned night,\\nWhen sparkling stars twire not, thou gild\\'st the even.\\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\\n  And night doth nightly make grief\\'s length seem stronger.\\n\\n29\\n\\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\\'s eyes,\\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\\nDesiring this man\\'s art and that man\\'s scope,\\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven\\'s gate;\\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings\\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\\n\\n30\\n\\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought\\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time\\'s waste;\\nThen can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\\nFor precious friends hid in death\\'s dateless night,\\nAnd weep afresh love\\'s long since canceled woe,\\nAnd moan th\\' expense of many a vanished sight.\\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o\\'er\\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\\n  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\\n  All losses are restored and sorrows end.\\n\\n31\\n\\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts\\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\\nAnd there reigns love and all love\\'s loving parts,\\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\\nHath dear religious love stol\\'n from mine eye,\\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear\\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie.\\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give;\\nThat due of many now is thine alone.\\n  Their images I loved I view in thee,\\n  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.\\n\\n32\\n\\nIf thou survive my well-contented day\\nWhen that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,\\nAnd shalt by fortune once more resurvey\\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\\nCompare them with the bett\\'ring of the time,\\nAnd though they be outstripped by every pen,\\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\\nO, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\\n\"Had my friend\\'s muse grown with this growing age,\\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought\\nTo march in ranks of better equipage.\\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\\n  Theirs for their style I\\'ll read, his for his love.\"\\n\\n33\\n\\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen\\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\\nKissing with golden face the meadows green,\\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy,\\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride\\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide,\\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace.\\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine\\nWith all-triumphant splendor on my brow,\\nBut, out alack, he was but one hour mine;\\nThe region cloud hath masked him from me now.\\n  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\\n  Suns of the world may stain when heaven\\'s sun staineth.\\n\\n34\\n\\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day\\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\\nTo let base clouds o\\'ertake me in my way,\\nHiding thy brav\\'ry in their rotten smoke?\\n\\'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break\\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak\\nThat heals the wound and cures not the disgrace.\\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss.\\nTh\\' offender\\'s sorrow lends but weak relief\\nTo him that bears the strong offense\\'s cross.\\n  Ah, but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\\n  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\\n\\n35\\n\\nNo more be grieved at that which thou hast done.\\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;\\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\\nMyself corrupting salving thy amiss,\\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are.\\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--\\nThy adverse party is thy advocate--\\nAnd \\'gainst myself a lawful plea commence.\\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate\\n  That I an accessary needs must be\\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\\n\\n36\\n\\nLet me confess that we two must be twain\\nAlthough our undivided loves are one;\\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\\nWhich though it alter not love\\'s sole effect,\\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love\\'s delight.\\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\\nNor thou with public kindness honor me\\nUnless thou take that honor from thy name.\\n  But do not so. I love thee in such sort\\n  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\n\\n37\\n\\nAs a decrepit father takes delight\\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\\nSo I, made lame by fortune\\'s dearest spite,\\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\\nOr any of these all, or all, or more,\\nEntitled in thy parts do crowned sit,\\nI make my love engrafted to this store.\\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised\\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give\\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed\\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live.\\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee.\\n  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.\\n\\n38\\n\\nHow can my muse want subject to invent\\nWhile thou dost breathe that pour\\'st into my verse\\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent\\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\\nO, give thyself the thanks if aught in me\\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight,\\nFor who\\'s so dumb that cannot write to thee\\nWhen thou thyself dost give invention light?\\nBe thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth\\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate;\\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\\n  If my slight muse do please these curious days,\\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\\n\\n39\\n\\nO, how thy worth with manners may I sing\\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring,\\nAnd what is \\'t but mine own when I praise thee?\\nEven for this let us divided live\\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\\nThat by this separation I may give\\nThat due to thee which thou deserv\\'st alone.\\nO absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove\\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave\\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,\\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain\\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\\n\\n40\\n\\nTake all my loves, my love, yea, take them all.\\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;\\nAll mine was thine before thou hadst this more.\\nThen, if for my love thou my love receivest,\\nI cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;\\nBut yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest\\nBy willful taste of what thyself refusest.\\nI do forgive thy robb\\'ry, gentle thief,\\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty;\\nAnd yet love knows it is a greater grief\\nTo bear love\\'s wrong than hate\\'s known injury.\\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\\n  Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.\\n\\n41\\n\\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits\\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\\nThy beauty and thy years full well befits,\\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won;\\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;\\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman\\'s son\\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\\nAy me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\\nAnd chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,\\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\\n  Hers, by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\\n  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.\\n\\n42\\n\\nThat thou hast her, it is not all my grief,\\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly;\\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\\nLoving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:\\nThou dost love her because thou know\\'st I love her,\\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\\nSuff\\'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.\\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love\\'s gain,\\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss;\\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross.\\n  But here\\'s the joy: my friend and I are one;\\n  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.\\n\\n43\\n\\nWhen most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,\\nFor all the day they view things unrespected;\\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee\\nAnd, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\\nThen thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright,\\nHow would thy shadow\\'s form form happy show\\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light\\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\\nHow would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made\\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade\\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\\n\\n44\\n\\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\\nInjurious distance should not stop my way,\\nFor then, despite of space, I would be brought\\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay.\\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\\nUpon the farthest earth removed from thee,\\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land\\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\\nBut, ah, thought kills me that I am not thought,\\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\\nBut that, so much of earth and water wrought,\\nI must attend time\\'s leisure with my moan;\\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow\\n  But heavy tears, badges of either\\'s woe.\\n\\n45\\n\\nThe other two, slight air and purging fire,\\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide;\\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\\nMy life, being made of four, with two alone\\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;\\nUntil life\\'s composition be recured\\nBy those swift messengers returned from thee,\\nWho even but now come back again, assured\\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me.\\n  This told, I joy; but then, no longer glad,\\n  I send them back again and straight grow sad.\\n\\n46\\n\\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war\\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight.\\nMine eye my heart thy picture\\'s sight would bar,\\nMy heart mine eye the freedom of that right.\\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\\nA closet never pierced with crystal eyes;\\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\\nTo \\'cide this title is impaneled\\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,\\nAnd by their verdict is determined\\nThe clear eyes\\' moiety and the dear heart\\'s part,\\n  As thus: mine eyes\\' due is thy outward part,\\n  And my heart\\'s right, thy inward love of heart.\\n\\n47\\n\\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other.\\nWhen that mine eye is famished for a look,\\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,\\nWith my love\\'s picture then my eye doth feast\\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart.\\nAnother time mine eye is my heart\\'s guest\\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part.\\nSo, either by thy picture or my love,\\nThyself away are present still with me;\\nFor thou no farther than my thoughts canst move,\\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee;\\n  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\\n  Awakes my heart to heart\\'s and eye\\'s delight.\\n\\n48\\n\\nHow careful was I, when I took my way,\\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\\nThat to my use it might unused stay\\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\\nThou best of dearest and mine only care\\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\\nThee have I not locked up in any chest,\\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol\\'n, I fear,\\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\\n\\n49\\n\\nAgainst that time, if ever that time come,\\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\\nWhenas thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\\nCalled to that audit by advised respects;\\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass\\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,\\nWhen love, converted from the thing it was,\\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here\\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\\nAnd this my hand against myself uprear\\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part.\\n  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\\n  Since why to love I can allege no cause.\\n\\n50\\n\\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\\nWhen what I seek, my weary travel\\'s end,\\nDoth teach that ease and that repose to say\\n\"Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.\"\\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\\nHis rider loved not speed, being made from thee.\\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on\\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side;\\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind:\\n  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.\\n\\n51\\n\\nThus can my love excuse the slow offense\\nOf my dull bearer when from thee I speed:\\nFrom where thou art, why should I haste me thence?\\nTill I return, of posting is no need.\\nO, what excuse will my poor beast then find\\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\\nThen should I spur, though mounted on the wind;\\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know.\\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace;\\nTherefore desire, of perfect\\'st love being made,\\nShall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race.\\nBut love for love thus shall excuse my jade:\\n  \"Since from thee going he went willful slow,\\n  Towards thee I\\'ll run, and give him leave to go.\"\\n\\n52\\n\\nSo am I as the rich whose blessed key\\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\\nThe which he will not ev\\'ry hour survey,\\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\\nSince seldom coming in the long year set,\\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest,\\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide\\nTo make some special instant special blessed\\nBy new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\\n  Being had, to triumph, being lacked, to hope.\\n\\n53\\n\\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\nSince everyone hath, every one, one shade,\\nAnd you, but one, can every shadow lend.\\nDescribe Adonis, and the counterfeit\\nIs poorly imitated after you;\\nOn Helen\\'s cheek all art of beauty set,\\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new.\\nSpeak of the spring and foison of the year;\\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\\nThe other as your bounty doth appear,\\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\\n  In all external grace you have some part,\\n  But you like none, none you, for constant heart.\\n\\n54\\n\\nO, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give.\\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\\nFor that sweet odor which doth in it live.\\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye\\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly\\nWhen summer\\'s breath their masked buds discloses;\\nBut, for their virtue only is their show,\\nThey live unwooed and unrespected fade,\\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;\\nOf their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made.\\n  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\\n  When that shall vade, by verse distils your truth.\\n\\n55\\n\\nNot marble nor the gilded monuments\\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\\nThan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.\\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\\nNor Mars his sword nor war\\'s quick fire shall burn\\nThe living record of your memory.\\n\\'Gainst death and all oblivious enmity\\nShall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\\n  So, till the judgment that yourself arise,\\n  You live in this, and dwell in lovers\\' eyes.\\n\\n56\\n\\nSweet love, renew thy force. Be it not said\\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\\nWhich but today by feeding is allayed,\\nTomorrow sharpened in his former might.\\nSo, love, be thou. Although today thou fill\\nThy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,\\nTomorrow see again, and do not kill\\nThe spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.\\nLet this sad int\\'rim like the ocean be\\nWhich parts the shore where two contracted new\\nCome daily to the banks, that, when they see\\nReturn of love, more blessed may be the view.\\n  Or call it winter, which being full of care\\n  Makes summer\\'s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\\n\\n57\\n\\nBeing your slave, what should I do but tend\\nUpon the hours and times of your desire?\\nI have no precious time at all to spend\\nNor services to do till you require.\\nNor dare I chide the world-without-end hour\\nWhilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,\\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour\\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu.\\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought\\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\\nBut, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought\\nSave where you are how happy you make those.\\n  So true a fool is love that in your will,\\n  Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.\\n\\n58\\n\\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\\nOr at your hand th\\' account of hours to crave,\\nBeing your vassal bound to stay your leisure.\\nO, let me suffer, being at your beck,\\nTh\\' imprisoned absence of your liberty,\\nAnd patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check\\nWithout accusing you of injury.\\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong\\nThat you yourself may privilege your time\\nTo what you will; to you it doth belong\\nYourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\\n  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\\n  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.\\n\\n59\\n\\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is\\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\\nWhich, laboring for invention, bear amiss\\nThe second burden of a former child.\\nO, that record could with a backward look,\\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\\nShow me your image in some antique book,\\nSince mind at first in character was done,\\nThat I might see what the old world could say\\nTo this composed wonder of your frame;\\nWhether we are mended, or whe\\'er better they,\\nOr whether revolution be the same.\\n  O, sure I am the wits of former days\\n  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\\n\\n60\\n\\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\\nEach changing place with that which goes before;\\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\\nNativity, once in the main of light,\\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\\nCrooked eclipses \\'gainst his glory fight,\\nAnd Time that gave doth now his gift confound.\\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth\\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty\\'s brow,\\nFeeds on the rarities of Nature\\'s truth,\\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\\n  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,\\n  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\\n\\n61\\n\\nIs it thy will thy image should keep open\\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken\\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\\nIs it thy spirit that thou send\\'st from thee\\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\\nThe scope and tenor of thy jealousy?\\nO, no.

Where, alack,\\nShall Time\\'s best jewel from Time\\'s chest lie hid?\\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,\\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\\n  O, none, unless this miracle have might,\\n  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\\n\\n66\\n\\nTired with all these, for restful death I cry:\\nAs, to behold desert a beggar born,\\nAnd needy nothing trimmed in

sway disabled,\\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\\nAnd folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\\nAnd simple truth miscalled simplicity,\\nAnd captive good attending captain ill.\\n  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\\n  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.\\n\\n67\\n\\nAh, wherefore with infection should he live,\\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve\\nAnd lace itself with his society?\\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek\\nAnd steal dead seeing of his living hue?\\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek\\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\\nWhy should he live, now Nature bankrout is,\\nBeggared of blood to blush through lively veins,\\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\\nAnd, proud of many, lives upon his gains?\\n  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had\\n  In days long since, before these last so bad.\\n\\n68\\n\\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were borne,\\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow;\\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\\nThe right of sepulchers, were shorn away\\nTo live a second life on second head,\\nEre beauty\\'s dead fleece made another gay.\\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\\nWithout all ornament, itself and true,\\nMaking no summer of another\\'s

is crowned,\\nBut those same tongues that give thee so thine own\\nIn other accents do this praise confound\\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\\nAnd that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;\\nThen, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds.\\n  But why thy odor matcheth not thy show,\\n  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\\n\\n70\\n\\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\\nFor slander\\'s mark was ever yet the fair.\\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\\nA crow that flies in heaven\\'s sweetest air.\\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve\\nThy worth the greater, being wooed of time,\\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\\nAnd thou present\\'st a pure unstained prime.\\nThou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\\nEither not assailed, or victor being charged;\\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise\\nTo tie up envy, evermore enlarged.\\n  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\\n  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\\n\\n71\\n\\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead\\nThan you shall hear

should task you to recite\\nWhat merit lived in me that you should love,\\nAfter my death, dear love, forget me quite,\\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove;\\nUnless you would devise some virtuous

worth.\\n\\n73\\n\\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\\nBare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.\\nIn me thou see\\'st the twilight of such day\\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\\nDeath\\'s second self, that seals up all in rest.\\nIn me thou see\\'st the glowing of such fire\\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\\nAs the death-bed whereon it must expire,\\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\\n  This thou perceiv\\'st, which makes thy love more strong,\\n  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.\\n\\n74\\n\\nBut be contented when that fell arrest\\nWithout all bail shall carry me away,\\nMy life hath in this line some interest,\\nWhich for memorial still with thee shall stay.\\nWhen thou reviewest this, thou dost review\\nThe very part was consecrate to thee.\\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due;\\nMy spirit is thine, the better part of me.\\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead,\\nThe coward conquest of a wretch\\'s knife,\\nToo base of thee to be remembered.\\n  The worth of that is that which it contains,\\n  And that is this, and this with thee remains.\\n\\n75\\n\\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\\nOr as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;\\nAnd for the peace of you I hold such strife\\nAs \\'twixt a miser and his wealth is found:\\nNow proud as an enjoyer, and anon\\nDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\\nNow counting best to be with you alone,\\nThen bettered that the world may see my pleasure.\\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look;\\nPossessing or pursuing no delight\\nSave what is had or must from you be took.\\n  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\\n  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\\n\\n76\\n\\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride,\\nSo far from variation or quick change?\\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\\nTo new-found methods and to compounds strange?\\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\\nShowing their birth and where they did proceed?\\nO, know, sweet love, I always write of you,\\nAnd you and love are still my argument;\\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\\nSpending again what is already spent.\\n  For as the sun is daily new and old,\\n  So is my love, still telling what is told.\\n\\n77\\n\\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\\nThe vacant leaves thy mind\\'s imprint will bear,\\nAnd of this book this learning mayst thou taste:\\nThe wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,\\nOf mouthed graves will give thee memory;\\nThou by thy dial\\'s shady stealth mayst know\\nTime\\'s thievish progress to eternity.\\nLook what thy memory cannot contain\\nCommit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\\nThose children nursed, delivered from thy brain,\\nTo take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\\n  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\\n  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\\n\\n78\\n\\nSo oft have I invoked thee for my muse\\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse\\nAs every alien pen hath got my use\\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\\nHave added feathers to the learned\\'s wing\\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\\nWhose influence is thine and born of thee.\\nIn others\\' works thou dost but mend the style,\\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces graced be.\\n  But thou art all my art and dost advance\\n  As high as learning my rude ignorance.\\n\\n79\\n\\nWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\\nMy verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\\nBut now my gracious numbers are decayed,\\nAnd my sick muse doth give another place.\\nI grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\\nDeserves the travail of a worthier pen;\\nYet what of thee thy poet doth invent\\nHe robs thee of and pays it thee again.\\nHe lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\\nFrom thy behavior; beauty doth he give\\nAnd found it in thy cheek.

Mowat and Paul Werstine\\n  with Michael Poston and Rebecca Niles\\nFolger Shakespeare Library\\nhttps://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/\\nCreated on Jul 31, 2015, from FDT version 0.9.0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,\\nThat thereby beauty's rose might never die,\\nBut, as the riper should by time decease,\\nHis tender heir might bear his memory.\",\n",
       " \"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,\\nFeed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.\",\n",
       " \"Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament\\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring\\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content\\nAnd, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding.\",\n",
       " \"Pity the world, or else this glutton be--\\n  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\",\n",
       " \"2\\n\\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow\\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\\nThy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,\\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held.\",\n",
       " 'Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,\\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days,\\nTo say within thine own deep-sunken eyes\\nWere an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.',\n",
       " 'How much more praise deserved thy beauty\\'s use\\nIf thou couldst answer \"This fair child of mine\\nShall sum my count and make my old excuse,\"\\nProving his beauty by succession thine.',\n",
       " \"This were to be new made when thou art old\\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.\",\n",
       " '3\\n\\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest\\nNow is the time that face should form another,\\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.',\n",
       " 'For where is she so fair whose uneared womb\\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?',\n",
       " 'Or who is he so fond will be the tomb\\nOf his self-love, to stop posterity?',\n",
       " \"Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee\\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime;\\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\\nDespite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.\",\n",

       " \"4\\n\\nUnthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend\\nUpon thyself thy beauty's legacy?\",\n",
       " \"Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\\nAnd being frank, she lends to those are free.\",\n",
       " 'Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?',\n",

       " 'For, having traffic with thyself alone,\\nThou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.',\n",

       " \"5\\n\\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;\\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\\nBeauty o'er-snowed and bareness everywhere.\",\n",
       " \"Then, were not summer's distillation left\\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\\nBeauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\",\n",

       " 'If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\nBy unions married, do offend thine ear,\\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.',\n",
       " 'Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,\\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering,\\nResembling sire and child and happy mother\\nWho, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;\\n  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,\\n  Sings this to thee: \"Thou single wilt prove none.\"',\n",
       " \"9\\n\\nIs it for fear to wet a widow's eye\\nThat thou consum'st thyself in single life?\",\n",
       " \"Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep\\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\\nBy children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind.\",\n",
       " \"Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\nBut beauty's waste hath in the world an end,\\nAnd, kept unused, the user so destroys it.\",\n",

       " 'Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\nWithout this, folly, age, and cold decay.',\n",
       " 'If all were minded so, the times should cease,\\nAnd threescore year would make the world away.',\n",
       " 'Let those whom nature hath not made for store,\\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish;\\nLook whom she best endowed she gave the more,\\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.',\n",
       " 'She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby\\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.',\n",
       " \"12\\n\\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time\\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\\nWhen I behold the violet past prime\\nAnd sable curls all silvered o'er with white;\\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\nAnd summer's green all girded up in sheaves\\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard;\\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow;\\n  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defense\\n  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\",\n",
       " '13\\n\\nO, that you were your self!',\n",
       " 'But, love, you are\\nNo longer yours than you yourself here live;\\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.',\n",

       " \"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,\\nFeed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.\",\n",
       " \"Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament\\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring\\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content\\nAnd, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding.\",\n",
       " \"Pity the world, or else this glutton be--\\n  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\",\n",
       " \"2\\n\\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow\\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\\nThy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,\\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held.\",\n",
       " 'Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,\\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days,\\nTo say within thine own deep-sunken eyes\\nWere an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.',\n",
       " 'How much more praise deserved thy beauty\\'s use\\nIf thou couldst answer \"This fair child of mine\\nShall sum my count and make my old excuse,\"\\nProving his beauty by succession thine.',\n",

       " '3\\n\\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest\\nNow is the time that face should form another,\\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.',\n",
       " 'For where is she so fair whose uneared womb\\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?',\n",
       " 'Or who is he so fond will be the tomb\\nOf his self-love, to stop posterity?',\n",
       " \"Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee\\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime;\\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\\nDespite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.\",\n",

       " \"4\\n\\nUnthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend\\nUpon thyself thy beauty's legacy?\",\n",
       " \"Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\\nAnd being frank, she lends to those are free.\",\n",
       " 'Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?',\n",

       " \"5\\n\\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;\\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\\nBeauty o'er-snowed and bareness everywhere.\",\n",
       " \"Then, were not summer's distillation left\\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\\nBeauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\",\n",

       " 'Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,\\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering,\\nResembling sire and child and happy mother\\nWho, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;\\n  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,\\n  Sings this to thee: \"Thou single wilt prove none.\"',\n",
